# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are a set of procedures that systematically arrange elements in a specific order. The order can be ascending or descending based on some criteria, such as numerical value, alphabetical order, or other defined rules. Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science and is used in various applications.

There are numerous sorting algorithms, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some common sorting algorithms include:

1. **Bubble Sort:**
   - A simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. **Selection Sort:**
   - This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning.

3. **Insertion Sort:**
   - Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms.

4. **Merge Sort:**
   - An efficient, stable, and comparison-based algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It divides the array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges them.

5. **Quick Sort:**
   - Another efficient, divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

6. **Heap Sort:**
   - Builds a binary heap from the elements and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap, leading to a sorted array.

7. **Radix Sort:**
   - Sorts numbers by processing individual digits. It can be applied to integers or strings.

The choice of which sorting algorithm to use depends on factors such as the size of the data set, the nature of the data, and the desired time or space complexity.

It's important to note that many programming languages provide built-in sorting functions, and these are often optimized for performance and should be preferred in most practical situations.
